# My Story of Learning Python

So today i am going to tell you about how i started my journey of learning *Python* since i was bored in my grade 11 winter break and had nothing to do.

## ❔ Chapter 1: Background

I previously had used **JavaScript** to make discord bots for my own server and since i made an online friend on discord who was very good at coding and programming things, he really made me *intrigued* to explore the world of coding. Watching him code on discord *screen share* i started coding using **Visual Studio Code** and made my very own discord bot using *JavaScript* hosted it using *Heroku* and for database used *MongoDB*.

So when i was new to the world of programming, i found out that there is a much easier language mostly like **English** called **Python**. So i went on *Youtube* and started watching begginner **Python** courses and started to learn basics of Python.

## 📕 Chapter 3: My very own public Github repository 

So my gaming world nickname was **FlyAbove**, i really don't know where i got that name in my mind from so i used that very nickname to create a github account where i made a public repository to teach python basics using comment feature in Python lanugage. The repository is still public and on the name of [python.py](https://github.com/FlyAbove/python.py). It went crazy i used to code and update the repository like a thousdan time every single day and i was stuck on computer for like *6 - 7 hours* each day. At some point this repository was getting *1000 views* every single day and was getting cloned by **hundreds**.

## 👋 Chapter 4: How i left the world of coding

So the winter break was about to over and my college was once again right around the corner and i had to focus on my studies all over again. I never thought that learning programming language which i loved so much, i would stop any time soon. But, reality hits and i had to focus on my studies too and at some day i never touched the repository again. The project got left in the middle and i was unable to complete it even tho i was almost done with teaching beginner level *Python*. I had plans to keep refining the repository with time once i was done too but everything got left and now it's touching the dust. I still look at that repository with time to time and look it with awe and do get proud of myself with it.

## 🔖 Chapter 5: Snippets and example from one of my file

```python
# Escape character is a backlash \ followed by character you want to insert
# To insert characters that are illegal in string we use an escape character


# If you need to wrap any character in a string with "" 
# To do that we use \

name = "name \"wrapped\""
example = "\' wrapped"

print(name)
print(example)

# To add backslash in string we use \\

name1 = "backslash\\"
print(name1)

# To add new line without creating a multi line string we use \n

name2 = "new\nline"
print(name2)

# To delete last character/space in the string we use \b

name3 = "back \bspace" 
print(name3)

```
 
## 🏫 Chapter 6: What i learned in my journey

| Feature | Description 
|----------------|-------------------------------------
| Nested if | Creates yes no and or programming 
| Data types | Types of Data in Python
| Escaping Character | Use \ to use an illegal character in python 
| Enums | Giving consant number to a variable  
| Input | Using iput() to get input from a user 
| f strings | Easier way to concatenate strings and variable

## ✨ Chapter 7: Conclusion

> Playing with **Python** and teaching **Python** was definetly fun and having this courses makes me relive that moment all over again. Using **Visual Studio Code** once again. The *dopamine* rush when the assignment's program finally runs and everything works smoothly. I still love playing with programming language and i think i always will.
